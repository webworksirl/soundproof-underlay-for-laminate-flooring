"@type": "Question","name": "why is Sylpro Acoustic Underlay great for soundproofing",
"acceptedAnswer": {
"@type": "Answer",
"text": "Sylpro Acoustic Underlay is an excellent choice for soundproofing due to several key characteristics that make it highly effective at reducing noise transmission and enhancing acoustic performance. Here are the main reasons why it stands out for soundproofing applications:


	
	High Density and Elasticity: Sylpro Acoustic Underlay is made from materials with high density and elasticity, which helps in absorbing and dissipating sound waves. The denser the material, the better it can prevent sound from traveling through floors, walls, and ceilings.
	
	
	Impact Noise Reduction: It is specifically designed to reduce impact noise, which is the sound created by objects coming into contact with the floor, such as footsteps, dropped items, or furniture movement. This makes it ideal for use in multi-story buildings where foot traffic noise can be a concern.
	
	
	Airborne Noise Insulation: Besides impact noise, Sylpro Acoustic Underlay also helps in reducing airborne noise, which includes sounds from voices, music, and TV. It acts as a barrier that helps to prevent sound from transmitting between rooms or floors.
	
	
	Compatibility with Various Flooring Types: This underlay is versatile and can be used under a wide range of flooring types, including hardwood, laminate, and tile. This flexibility makes it a suitable choice for different applications and settings, from residential to commercial spaces.
	
	
	Easy Installation: Sylpro Acoustic Underlay is designed for ease of installation. It can be easily cut and fitted around corners and edges, making it a convenient option for both new constructions and renovation projects.
	
	
	Eco-friendly Options: Many Sylpro products are made with environmentally friendly materials, offering a sustainable choice for those looking to minimize their environmental impact without compromising on soundproofing effectiveness.
	
	
	Enhanced Comfort: Beyond soundproofing, it also improves the overall comfort of a space by providing additional thermal insulation and a softer walking surface, contributing to a more comfortable and quiet environment.

"@type": "Question","name": "Are Acoustic Underlays Easy to Fit",
"acceptedAnswer": {
"@type": "Answer",
"text": "You might be asking yourself, &quot;Is it simple to install acoustic underlays?&quot; Well, there&#39;s great news: fitting acoustic underlays is incredibly straightforward, eliminating the need for a large team of professionals to accomplish the task. These underlays typically come in rolls or sheets, which simplifies the process of cutting them to the right size and laying them under your flooring.

Begin by ensuring the subfloor is clean, then unroll the underlay and trim it as needed. Some types of acoustic underlay even feature an adhesive layer on one side, doing away with the necessity for extra glue or tape. This user-friendly setup means that even those new to DIY projects can easily undertake the installation. So, dive into enhancing your space with soundproofing&mdash;both your peace of mind and your neighbors will be appreciative."
}
},{
"@type": "Question","name": "How Does Acoustic Underlay Stop Sound?",
"acceptedAnswer": {
"@type": "Answer",
"text": "The mechanics behind soundproof floor underlayment are a fascinating blend of engineering brilliance and acoustic principles. To grasp how they mitigate noise, it&#39;s essential to distinguish between the two main categories of sound: airborne and impact. Airborne sounds include things like voices or music, whereas impact sounds arise from actions such as footsteps or shifting furniture. Acoustic underlays are designed to tackle both types of noise, offering a seamless acoustic solution to our sound-related challenges.

The effectiveness of an underlay in soundproofing stems from its capacity to absorb and neutralize energy. As sound waves encounter the underlay, its composition&mdash;whether foam, rubber, or cork&mdash;undergoes slight deformation. This process allows the underlay to absorb the sound energy and transform it into heat, which is then dispersed inconsequentially. This conversion of energy prevents the sound from propagating and entering your living space. Regarding impact noise, the underlay&#39;s specific thickness and density act as a buffer, soaking up the vibrations and diminishing their spread through the flooring. The outcome is a quiet haven, affording you the luxury of tranquil, undisturbed serenity."

<p>Nothing is worse than being in your home or apartment and hearing unwanted noises from above. This can be caused by children running (which sounds like a herd elephants), furniture moving, music, or TV noise. The popularity of hard floors such as tiles, laminate and hardwood in our homes also increases the impact noise. The good news: peace and quiet are possible by investing in soundproofing flooring under-layment.</p><p>Are you ready to invest in an acoustic sublay? Browse the collection today and order online. You are wel-come to contact us if you have questions about our products and how they can benefit you. We are al-ways happy to assist you. Simply give us a call on 07553 473877 or send an email to in-fo@buildtecacoustics.co.uk</p><p>In this blog we hope to answer some of the questions you might have when choosing the right acoustic underlay solution. It's important not to confuse carpet underlay with soundproofing underlay. Carpet underlay is fitted to add comfort to carpets, allowing a more precise fit and to help against heavy wear. Carpet underlays, although they can claim to offer soundproofing properties won't perform anywhere near the level that specific soundproofing underlay and soundproofing mats do. Carpet underlays also aren't tested for their soundproofing qualities in the same way soundproofing underlay and mats are. Be wise to a top trick, whereby companies selling carpet underlay as having soundproofing qualities quote a dB figure, however this only shows how much airborne noise is blocked on a concrete floor, of which the carpet underlay is only 5%. If you are looking to soundproof under a carpet, then we will cover the best products on the market below.</p><p>Lastly, the Sylwood Acoustic Underlay for Engineered Floors is a versatile option with minimal thickness and easy installation. It is also manufactured from recycled materials.</p></div>

<div> <p>Among the top choices for acoustic underlays, these five options stand out for their exceptional sound-proofing performance and versatility.The first option is the Sylpro Acoustic Underlay, known for its high-density composition and compatibility with underfloor heating systems. It offers Regupol K225, Damtec, and Soundsense equivalent performance.</p><p>It is important to note that every 10 decibels (dB) of noise reduction will be perceived as roughly halving the perceived volume. If you hear a sound measuring 70dB but it drops to 60dB it will sound half as loud.</p><p>Sound is broken down by airborne noise (transmitted through the atmosphere) talking, TV noise, dogs barking etc and impact noise (the physical impact of two solids hitting one another, footfall, doors bang-ing,walking, furniture moving etc).</p><p>Buidtec Acoustic Underlay is suitable for use directly beneath laminate flooring. You should use the pe-rimeter edging to make sure the gripper rods and laminate are the same height when installing the un-derlay. Use a 30mm nail to attach the gripper rods as well as the perimeter edging.Between the soundproofing layer and the hard floor finish, such as laminate, engineered and tiles, a resil-ient layer should be used. We recommend using a sheet of material like ply, or MDF interlocking. The layers are adhered using Isobond, a flooring adhesive. Isolate the flooring with isolation tape attached to the wall to prevent flanking sounds from being transmitted from the floor up to the walls.</p><p>According to figures, Buildtec Acoustics underlay reduces impact and airborne noises by 51dB in the case of impact sounds and 54dB in the case of airborne noises. This solution is not only compliant with Part E standards, but also blocks airborne and impact sounds effectively.</p></div>

<div><p>MegaMat is suitable for use under the final finish of most hardwood floors without adding an additional over-board layer. When using MegaMat P for acoustic floors, any engineered flooring that is 18mm thick or more can be installed directly on top. We recommend 6mm hardboard for any thin hard finish to en-sure a stable, flat base.</p><p>Buildtec Acoustics underlay offers a significant reduction in noise compared to standard floor construc-tions. As part of a floor system, it will help ensure compliance with Part E for new constructions and con-versions.</p><p>It is important to note that every 10 decibels (dB) of noise reduction will be perceived as roughly halving the perceived volume. If you hear a sound measuring 70dB but it drops to 60dB it will sound half as loud.</p><p>Looking for a way to reduce noisy footsteps in your home or office? If so, acoustic underlay could be a worthwhile investment. This specialist type of underlayment is suitable for both domestic and commer-cial use. Paired with carpet, hardwood or laminate flooring, it will successfully reduce impact and air-borne noises - creating a quieter, more peaceful environment.</p></div>

<div> <p>Just as the name suggests, the main advantage of acoustic underlay is that it demonstrates excellent acoustic properties. Typically made from PU foam or wool felt, it absorbs sound vibrations - minimising unwanted echoes and impact noises within the room and reducing their transfer throughout the build-ing.</p><p>Among the premier selections for acoustic underlays, the Sylpro Acoustic Underlay dis-tinguishes itself with its dense composition, ensuring compatibility with underfloor heating systems and mirroring the effectiveness of brands like Regupol K225, Damtec, and Soundsense. Similarly, the Sylpro AD Acoustic Underlay not only provides excellent sound insulation due to its high density but also supports LEED certification efforts and boasts castor-proof features, making it a top choice for eco-conscious installations.</p><p>Any of our soundproofing tiles can be underlayed with any of our mats. You would then need to add a layer of 12mm hardwood on top of the underlay before installing floor tiles. The small, fragile tiles are not suitable for soft, cushioned underlays (which is what the acoustic base is). This increases the risk of the tiles breaking and cracking. The hardwood creates a firm and stable floor to which the tiles can be at-tached.</p><p>HighMat has a thin system that is ideal for floors with hard finishes. It also includes a stabilising layer. The soundproofing properties of wood floors are greatly improved by combining 3 layers of soundproofing mass with an impact dampening surface.</p><p>The second option is the Sylpro AD Acoustic Underlay, which contributes points towards LEED certifica-tion and has a high-density composition for unparalleled soundproofing. It is also castor-proof and com-patible with underfloor heating systems.</p><p>Aside from its acoustic properties, soundproof underlay also has a number of other benefits. For example, it often improves the underfoot comfort of the flooring. Thanks to its thick construction, it adds an addi-tional layer of insulation and offers superior thermal protection. It's also incredibly easy to install and can be used in a diverse range of rooms - in both the home and workplace.</p></div>

<div> <p>All the soundproofing mats above can be used to create a laminate soundproofing underlay. It is the same for vinyl or cushioned underlay soundproofing. To ensure a stable and flat base, we recommend that a minimum 6mm hardboard layer be placed on top of any soundproofing underlay before installing the vinyl or laminate.</p><p>Basewood targets wooden floors with its thin profile and glue-free application, crafted from recycled content. Sylcer caters to ceramic floors with its straightforward setup and eco-friendly make. Lastly, Sylwood offers a thin, easy-to-install solution for engineered floors, also made from recycled materials.</p><p>The second paragraph shifts attention to the Sylpro AD Acoustic Underlay, a variant that not only excels in soundproofing but also contributes to environmental sustaina-bility by aiding in LEED certification. Its high-density composition and castor-proof qualities make it an ideal choice for projects prioritizing green building principles.</p><p>Nothing is worse than being in your home or apartment and hearing unwanted noises from above. This can be caused by children running (which sounds like a herd elephants), furniture moving, music, or TV noise. The popularity of hard floors such as tiles, laminate and hardwood in our homes also increases the impact noise.The good news: peace and quiet are possible by investing in soundproofing flooring underlayment.</p><p>For thin floor finishes like laminates, tiles and vinyl, you will need to fix a board over the Soundproofing Mat. It is designed to be laid over existing floorboards and provides a stable, strong and level base for hard flooring finishes. It eliminates the need for an additional stabilising layer and reduces installation costs.</p> </div>

</div>
<div class="collapse" id="collapse3" aria-labelledby="heading3" data-parent="#faqAccordion">
<div class="card-body"><p>The mechanics behind soundproof floor underlayment are a fascinating blend of engineering brilliance and acoustic principles. To grasp how they mitigate noise, it&#39;s essential to distinguish between the two main categories of sound: airborne and impact. Airborne sounds include things like voices or music, whereas impact sounds arise from actions such as footsteps or shifting furniture. Acoustic underlays are designed to tackle both types of noise, offering a seamless acoustic solution to our sound-related challenges.</p>

<p>The effectiveness of an underlay in soundproofing stems from its capacity to absorb and neutralize energy. As sound waves encounter the underlay, its composition&mdash;whether foam, rubber, or cork&mdash;undergoes slight deformation. This process allows the underlay to absorb the sound energy and transform it into heat, which is then dispersed inconsequentially. This conversion of energy prevents the sound from propagating and entering your living space. Regarding impact noise, the underlay&#39;s specific thickness and density act as a buffer, soaking up the vibrations and diminishing their spread through the flooring. The outcome is a quiet haven, affording you the luxury of tranquil, undisturbed serenity.</p>
